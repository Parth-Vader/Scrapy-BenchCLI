The show's visual sense of framing is top-notch, Michael Stuhlbarg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead nearly vanish in their roles—and it must be noted that Carrie Coon's impressive performance as local cop Gloria Burgle is taking place while Coon's \u003Ci\u003E other\u003C\u002Fi\u003E current acting achievement, on HBO's \u003Ci\u003E The Leftovers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, is airing as well. Lots of people liked \u003Ci\u003E Fargo\u003C\u002Fi\u003E's retro-leaning second season, but I was left cold by it: There was style in spades, but it lacked the elegant dread of the show's still-unbeatable first season.

The vivid details of how far-right terrorist Anders Breivik planned and executed his horrifying attacks—alongside accounts of his upbringing, the trial that followed, the waves of grief experienced by the victims' loved ones, and Norwegian authorities' outright failures to contain and prevent the attacks themselves—are a lot to stomach, and it makes Asne Seierstad's evocatively written tome almost impossible to recommend. And yet: I do think everyone should read this book. Not to get all \"in our current political climate,\" but in our current political climate it's paramount to understand the origins of extremism and evil, and how extremists envision the violent ends to their altogether hateful and misguided means.

But there's no show on television that makes the mundanity of life so impossibly fascinating. Over the past few years, the chronicle of \u003Ci\u003E Breaking Bad\u003C\u002Fi\u003E n'er-do-well Saul Goodman's descent into middleman evil has elegantly and heartbreakingly deconstructed basic themes like love, family, and trust, and the current season is all the more strong for a trio of performances that are gripping in their own right. There's Bob Odenkirk's rascally and fleetingly empathetic pout, Michael McKean's depiction of a man losing sight of his own sense of reason as he desperately tries to assert himself, and Rhea Seehorn's subtly devastating and indisputably doomed sense of devotion to the man whose name gives the show its title. Not exactly feel-good stuff, but if you watched all of \u003Ci\u003E Breaking Bad\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, you're well aware that feeling good is not the name of the game here, so buckle up. —\u003Ci\u003E LF\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ch2\u003E\u003Ci\u003E 7 Days in Hell\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E \u003Cdiv data-iframely-id=\"E3utFWj\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003E\u003Ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"\u002F\u002Foembed.vice.com\u002FE3utFWj?playerjs=true\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndy Samberg's pro cycling goof-off \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=fVpRr1-PGgM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Ci\u003E Tour De Pharmacy\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E comes to HBO in about a month and change (July 8 if you're a stickler for details), but if you can't wait that long, now's a good time to visit (or revisit) the hour-long \u003Ci\u003E 7 Days in Hell\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, in which Samberg and \u003Ci\u003E Game of Thrones\u003C\u002Fi\u003E' Kit Harrington play pro tennis players who engage in the longest match in Wimbledon history. The conceit is taken even further than you'd expect, and the sight gags are boundless—not to mention legitimately funny turns from people like David Copperfield, Serena Williams, and Michael Sheen, the latter being one of the Samberg-adjacent comedy world's best secret weapons.

The vivid details of how far-right terrorist Anders Breivik planned and executed his horrifying attacks—alongside accounts of his upbringing, the trial that followed, the waves of grief experienced by the victims' loved ones, and Norwegian authorities' outright failures to contain and prevent the attacks themselves—are a lot to stomach, and it makes Asne Seierstad's evocatively written tome almost impossible to recommend. And yet: I do think everyone should read this book. Not to get all \"in our current political climate,\" but in our current political climate it's paramount to understand the origins of extremism and evil, and how extremists envision the violent ends to their altogether hateful and misguided means. Sometimes, the hardest elements of modern society to confront are also the most vital to acquire a deeper understanding of. —\u003Ci\u003E LF\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E \u003Ci\u003ENancy\u003C\u002Fi\u003E From WNYC\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Sincere shouts to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcarsonmell\u002Fstatus\u002F867209403862196224\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBlue Apron\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fjonfavs\u002Fstatus\u002F764606179645333504?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EMeUndies\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, because their seemingly limitless marketing budgets have birthed the golden age of the podcast.

But there's no show on television that makes the mundanity of life so impossibly fascinating. Over the past few years, the chronicle of \u003Ci\u003E Breaking Bad\u003C\u002Fi\u003E n'er-do-well Saul Goodman's descent into middleman evil has elegantly and heartbreakingly deconstructed basic themes like love, family, and trust, and the current season is all the more strong for a trio of performances that are gripping in their own right. There's Bob Odenkirk's rascally and fleetingly empathetic pout, Michael McKean's depiction of a man losing sight of his own sense of reason as he desperately tries to assert himself, and Rhea Seehorn's subtly devastating and indisputably doomed sense of devotion to the man whose name gives the show its title.

The show's visual sense of framing is top-notch, Michael Stuhlbarg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead nearly vanish in their roles—and it must be noted that Carrie Coon's impressive performance as local cop Gloria Burgle is taking place while Coon's \u003Ci\u003E other\u003C\u002Fi\u003E current acting achievement, on HBO's \u003Ci\u003E The Leftovers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, is airing as well. Lots of people liked \u003Ci\u003E Fargo\u003C\u002Fi\u003E's retro-leaning second season, but I was left cold by it: There was style in spades, but it lacked the elegant dread of the show's still-unbeatable first season.

The vivid details of how far-right terrorist Anders Breivik planned and executed his horrifying attacks—alongside accounts of his upbringing, the trial that followed, the waves of grief experienced by the victims' loved ones, and Norwegian authorities' outright failures to contain and prevent the attacks themselves—are a lot to stomach, and it makes Asne Seierstad's evocatively written tome almost impossible to recommend. And yet: I do think everyone should read this book. Not to get all \"in our current political climate,\" but in our current political climate it's paramount to understand the origins of extremism and evil, and how extremists envision the violent ends to their altogether hateful and misguided means.

But there's no show on television that makes the mundanity of life so impossibly fascinating. Over the past few years, the chronicle of \u003Ci\u003E Breaking Bad\u003C\u002Fi\u003E n'er-do-well Saul Goodman's descent into middleman evil has elegantly and heartbreakingly deconstructed basic themes like love, family, and trust, and the current season is all the more strong for a trio of performances that are gripping in their own right. There's Bob Odenkirk's rascally and fleetingly empathetic pout, Michael McKean's depiction of a man losing sight of his own sense of reason as he desperately tries to assert himself, and Rhea Seehorn's subtly devastating and indisputably doomed sense of devotion to the man whose name gives the show its title. Not exactly feel-good stuff, but if you watched all of \u003Ci\u003E Breaking Bad\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, you're well aware that feeling good is not the name of the game here, so buckle up. —\u003Ci\u003E LF\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ch2\u003E\u003Ci\u003E 7 Days in Hell\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E \u003Cdiv data-iframely-id=\"E3utFWj\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003E\u003Ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"\u002F\u002Foembed.vice.com\u002FE3utFWj?playerjs=true\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndy Samberg's pro cycling goof-off \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=fVpRr1-PGgM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Ci\u003E Tour De Pharmacy\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E comes to HBO in about a month and change (July 8 if you're a stickler for details), but if you can't wait that long, now's a good time to visit (or revisit) the hour-long \u003Ci\u003E 7 Days in Hell\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, in which Samberg and \u003Ci\u003E Game of Thrones\u003C\u002Fi\u003E' Kit Harrington play pro tennis players who engage in the longest match in Wimbledon history. The conceit is taken even further than you'd expect, and the sight gags are boundless—not to mention legitimately funny turns from people like David Copperfield, Serena Williams, and Michael Sheen, the latter being one of the Samberg-adjacent comedy world's best secret weapons.

Tell Us the Most Desperate Stuff They've Done in Breakups","body":"\u003Cp\u003EIt's normal to get a bit irrational after a breakup. For a few weeks, it's somewhat socially acceptable to break down in tears in the middle of a shopping center or live on five-day-old pasta while obsessively scrolling through old photos. Or worse. Because some people take it a hell of a lot further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EWe spoke to three people who have acted, well, a bit crazily during breakups. These are people who our friends have labeled as their \"psycho exes,\" who we then chased for their side of the story. Turns out, the psycho ex-stereotypes weren't so black and white.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAll names have been changed, obviously.\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ch2\u003ESamantha, 26, Science Student\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI've never coped well with breakups, but in my early 20s, I was particularly bad. I had been in a bad relationship when I was 19, and I had trouble assessing things properly after that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI hooked up with this guy a few years ago. He had been telling me personal things, like how he was struggling with depression. And after we slept together, he started ignoring all my messages and my calls. I didn't understand how someone who had been talking to me for weeks could suddenly switch to being so cold. He was living with my friend at the time, so one day when I was over I climbed through the window into his room and left a poem I had written for him on his bed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI knew he had been going through a hard time, so I thought it was a sweet gesture. Instead, he got freaked out and messaged me to never contact him again. Then he blocked me on all his social media. Then I responded by hacking into my friends' Facebook accounts to message him, or I would comment on statuses and photos he was tagged in. I was so obsessive that it almost became a high, getting some sort of a reaction out of him. He kept ignoring me or sent me really mean messages telling me to fuck off, and then eventually the thrill just faded for me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EAnother time, a guy I had been seeing for a few months left me in a random suburb after a night out because he didn't want me to go back to his house for fear I would meet his family. He threw my handbag out of the car, so then I had to get out and get it, and then he drove off. My phone was dead, and I was really drunk, so I had to walk more than 40 minutes by myself in the middle of the night to find a taxi.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI didn't understand why he was treating me like that. I wanted some sort of validation or control or understanding. So the next day I drove to where he left me, and drove around the streets until I found his parked car. Then I sat outside the house quite regularly for the next few weeks, until I ended up knocking on the door to see him. He didn't know how I found his house and blocked me on everything afterward. For a few months after that, though, he would continue to text me occasionally and sleep with me. While at the same time calling me crazy and a psycho to his friends.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EAround that same time, if my housemates had male friends over, I would sneak into their beds at night. I would have sex with strangers in alleyways, in pub bathrooms, and in parks. Even though I acted like that, I was always searching for some sort of validation, and that's why I was very intense when I thought I was forming an actual connection. I'm in a serious relationship right now, and I've been dealing a lot better with my own issues. I don't think I'll ever behave in those ways again. I feel a lot stronger in myself now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg?resize=1024:*\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763535548-5942090561_8656911f4b_b.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003EImage by Flickr user Amanda Hinault\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Ch2\u003EPaul, 26, Administration Worker\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E \u003Cp\u003EWe met over Grindr, and we were together for just over two years. Although he slowly pushed me away over the span of four months, the breakup still felt sudden, and I didn't really understand why it had happened.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI started a fake Grindr profile to find out where he was, what he was doing, and how far away he was from me. I would memorize the distance and know what he was doing, whether he was at work or at the gym. For instance, if he was 2 miles away, I knew he was at home. It was monitoring where he was and when he was online. It gave me a rush, almost. In the sense of when you know you shouldn't be doing something, but you do it anyway. It also hurt, doing it. But at the same time, I had comfort. I couldn't have him, but by doing that, I had some control over the situation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI would often drive past his house to see if his light was on. He always used to have this lamp that he would switch on to make ambient lighting for when he had sex. I would drive past with the hope that I would never see that lamp on. I would know that if the ambient red light was there, then he was hooking up with someone else. I also drove to his house and stood behind the bushes in the hope I would see him. I didn't want him to see me, but for me to see him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EWe had sex once about six weeks after we broke up. I was hoping it would fix everything, but it didn't. When I was over there, I stole a shirt from him, his bed shirt at the time. So I could smell him. I took it for comfort and to keep him close, in a sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIt's been 14 months now, but even in recent months, I still drive to where I think he is. The feeling is less of a rush, though. I'm dealing with it better, but I still find myself looking for him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI know I'm not great at managing loss. I don't think I'd ever do it again, but [my behavior] was heavily swayed towards how the breakup took place, in the sudden, Band-Aid rip type of way. I haven't looked for any of his photos on social media for about seven weeks now. Now it's at the stage where it's like \"don't do it because it'll break your record.\" It's been a matter of time and self-management.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg?resize=1000:*\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495763569294-8654493490_24c20458db_k.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003EImage by Flickr user Brandon Giesbrecht\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Ch2\u003EFrances, 24, Med Student\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E \u003Cp\u003EHarry* and I met in 2011, but we didn't get to know each other until 2012.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI got drunk one night, and my boss kissed me.

And I did.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI would go through intense phases of hating Harry's guts to reading every old letter he wrote me in the four years we dated, including old grocery lists. I'd listen to songs that reminded me of him and read the letters and sob uncontrollably for hours. It was to the point where I'd have at least two [emotional breakdowns] a week. I went to counseling for a while, but it didn't help. I did get prescribed an anti-anxiety medication for the bad days.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI used to talk to his friends for updates. [One of them] told me Harry was dating some girl who was barely 20 from his nasty little hometown. I still stalk her Facebook. That hurts a lot to think about. Fuck that girl. She spells her name stupidly and wears stupid clothes, both of which I know bother Harry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI got dinner with a friend of mine two nights ago, and he told me his version of my break up. My extreme swings from being OK to being hysterical and bawling on the floor. From being almost normal to doing coke every time it was there. And how I either tried to fill the hole where Harry was, and how I tried to skip all the steps and just have guys love me, or how I would have no actual interest in the guys I slept with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI still fantasize about waking up and driving to Harry's job, walking in and demanding that he love me back. Or, driving there and letting the air out of his tires. Either way, I'd be close to him again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI still have all the letters Harry wrote, and I've read them twice since January. I have had two serious emotional breakdowns since then, but that's a huge improvement. It's been ten months, but I know I've got a long way to go.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vice.com\u002Fen_us\u002Farticle\u002Fpeople-tell-us-the-most-desperate-stuff-theyve-done-in-breakups","summary":null,"suggested_tweet":null,"dek":"\"I

Doug Liman's latest film—one of two to see release this year from the veteran American filmmaker, with his Tom Cruise drama \u003Ci\u003E American Made\u003C\u002Fi\u003E dropping in the fall—is the kind of movie that will cause you to twist and turn in your seat throughout its economical and perfectly paced 90-minute runtime. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Set in 2007 amid the gradual winding down of the Iraq War, the film zooms in on a pair of US military snipers (John Cena and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, both flexing impressive acting chops here) as they're pinned—literally—behind the titular and ramshackle wall, caught in the crosshairs of an Iraqi sniper with a deadly shot and impressive camouflage skills. There's a measure of soul-searching on our presumptive heroes' behalf, both of the personal and political kind, but this movie is all about survival, and the lengths human instinct takes us to stay alive. Plus, it might just have the best ending of any American film this year (although the alternately creepy and boring \u003Ci\u003E Life\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, from earlier this year, gives it a run for its money in this department).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E We sat down with Liman in the lobby of Manhattan's Bowery Hotel to talk about the film, working with Taylor-Johnson and Cena, and how the film industry's changed over his impressive two-decade-plus career. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv data-iframely-id=\"XtgMgdP\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003E\u003Ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"\u002F\u002Foembed.vice.com\u002FXtgMgdP?playerjs=true\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E VICE: I \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vice.com\u002Fen_us\u002Farticle\u002Faaron-taylor-johnson-got-his-latest-role-by-playing-ping-pong\"\u003E spoke with Aaron this morning\u003C\u002Fa\u003E,\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cb\u003E and he was telling me he went through a lot to get this role.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cb\u003E Doug Liman:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E In general, making movies doesn't get easier—they each pose their own challenges, especially if you're not repeating yourself. You have things you can't do because you did it already. One of the areas where it actually does get easier is when Aaron Taylor-Johnson shows up in my office unannounced. He was like, \"I'm your guy.\" Someone of that caliber walking through my door—that wasn't happening when I was making \u003Ci\u003E Swingers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, you know? People weren't banging down my door to make \u003Ci\u003E The Bourne Identity\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. I had to convince somebody.\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cb\u003E He mentioned you guys played ping-pong when you first met.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E We did. We spent a while talking about the movie and his character, and I have a ping-pong table in the office, so I gathered that we might as well play ping-pong while we're at it. He wasn't that good, so I switched to my left hand. I gather he was seeing it as more of an audition—I was just talking about the movie and playing ping-pong. I don't like anyone telling me what to do, so even though I recognized right there that he would be extraordinary in the movie, I was like, \"Who else is out there?\" But he continued to hound me—he even sent me a picture of himself as a chauffeur waiting with a sign for me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E I think he knew he was going to be in the movie before I did, so I had to catch up to him. I was looking for somebody young, because we're talking about soldiers. When I made \u003Ci\u003E The OC\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, I wanted to cast 17- and 18-year-old actors to play high schoolers. With this movie, I didn't want to do the normal Hollywood thing and cast Brad Pitt as a soldier. The people who fight our wars are 18 to 20 years old—if they have seniority, they're 25. I was looking for somebody who could hold a movie the way Tom Hanks did in \u003Ci\u003E Cast Away\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. It didn't take me long to realize there really was no one but Aaron. He was right when he said, \"It's me.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EEdge of Tomorrow\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cb\u003E had such an epic scope—this film's much smaller in comparison. What led you to take this project on?\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E It all started with Dwain Worrell's script, which was sent to me as a writing sample. I read it and said, \"Who's directing this movie?\" I expected them to say, \"David Ayer's directing it. David Fincher's directing it.\" But they were like, \"No one's directing it.\" No one thought I would be interested in a film of this size, but I've made a career of gravitating toward projects that people—the powers that be—thought I wouldn't be interested in. After I made \u003Ci\u003E Swingers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, the pressure was on to make a studio comedy, and John August had written a little film called \u003Ci\u003E Go\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. They said, \"Well, Doug's never going to want to do another little indie movie,\" so John was told not to send it to me. But he did, and on a fluke, I read it and surprised everybody by saying, \"I want to make another independent movie after \u003Ci\u003E Swingers.\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\" \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E I don't make \"career decisions.\" I make decisions based on reading scripts and saying, \"I want to tell this story,\" and \u003Ci\u003E The Wall \u003C\u002Fi\u003Ewas just a script I read. I wasn't thinking about the scale of the movie when I was reading the script, and hopefully you're not thinking of that while you're watching the movie—you're getting caught up in the experience. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Once I decide I want to make a movie, I try to set a budget that will push me to make the most creative movie. A lot of times—like on \u003Ci\u003E Mr. and Mrs. Smith\u003C\u002Fi\u003E—I've felt like I had too much money, and I ended up squandering a lot of it on sequences that never made it into the final movie. It wasn't until my back was against the wall, and I was out of money that \u003Ci\u003E Mr. and Mrs. Smith\u003C\u002Fi\u003E became the movie it became. A producer I worked with joked that he doesn't even bother looking at anything I shoot before lunch—he waits until after lunch, when I'm worried about the end of the day coming. I really wanted to have that pressure on me for \u003Ci\u003E The Wall\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, because I had that pressure on me for \u003Ci\u003E Swingers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495812729501-TW-D01-00040-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003EDoug Liman and John Cena on set. (Credit: David James. Amazon Studios\u002FRoadside Attractions)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E How have you seen the studio system and the industry change as you've worked through the years?\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E Most of the changes I've noticed as a bystander, because my own experiences have been fairly consistent. I took big chances early in my career—everything about \u003Ci\u003E Swingers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E was a chance. I gambled on the actors who had never been in anything, telling a story like this, and making a movie under these conditions. All of those gambles paid off. \u003Ci\u003E The Bourne Identity\u003C\u002Fi\u003E was an extremely unconventional studio action film that Universal hated while I was making it. Everybody was trying to walk away from it when it was coming out. The writer who wrote the script arbitrated against himself to not get sole credit, for the first and only time in Writer's Guild history. They didn't know what to make of the movie, but obviously it was a big hit. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Once you've taken a few chances and they've paid off, the system wants you to continue to take chances. You get typecast as, \"He takes chances and tries to reinvent genres.\" So you get sent the more interesting projects. If someone's presenting me something that feels a little bit conventional, they're saying, \"It's conventional, but we want you to put it through your filter and come out the other side looking totally original.\" It's extremely hard to be really original in a commercial setting, but it's easier to be original if you don't have to be commercial.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E A lot of times in my career, I've taken chances. In \u003Ci\u003E The Bourne Identity\u003Cspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, I didn't want to take the girl hostage in the third act. In film school, they call that a \"WIJ\": woman in jeopardy. They have an acronym for it because it was so common. I told Matt Damon early on, \"We're not going to have a WIJ.\" Then, I got to a place where I couldn't figure out the ending, and I turned to Matt and said, \"You know, I think we're going to have to have a WIJ, because it solves all our problems. There's a reason why some of these cliché elements exist—because they work.\" But Matt was like, \"You promised me we weren't going to have a WIJ.\" So I was like, \"Fuck, I did promise him that.\" So I went back to the drawing board and came up with a way to end the movie without a WIJ. I'm trying to make original movies that are commercial. That's my genre.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E Does this film have a political bent?\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E If there's a political bent to the movie, it's to shine a light onto the soldiers who are actually out there fighting every day. I loved that Dwain's script provided the chance to make a war movie that has no opinion on war. \u003Ci\u003E The Wall\u003C\u002Fi\u003E has a very positive opinion on American soldiers—they're almost like superheroes. All of the gear they bring into battle with them, they're like Iron Man. These guys carry 50 pounds worth of stuff.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E I didn't want this movie to look like the evening news. And these soldiers aren't on the news anymore, but they're still out there fighting. I don't think you'll find a week where there's not an American soldier who's died in combat. It's never in the news, but they're out there every day fighting and giving up their lives. Let's make the soldiers the story—not the generals, not the people in Washington, but the actual people who have to go and fight. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E John and Aaron's characters have this natural chemistry that's very appealing and real-seeming.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E Casting John Cena was key. I wanted somebody who you felt was going to save the day. If you've ever met John Cena, he comes into the room and makes you feel like everything's going to be OK. It was really important to me for the film to have that tonality.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E For me, the film is an uplifting story. I look for something personal in all my movies, and what I have in common with Aaron's and John's characters is perseverance. That's my main skill in the movie business. As you pointed out, I oftentimes don't get it right, but I persevere, I go back, and I keep at it until I get it right. Aaron's and John's characters don't give up—they keep trying. Just when you think they can't possibly keep going, they pick themselves up and try a new tactic to survive. That speaks to me on a personal level, and it's probably the reason why I wanted to make the movie.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Ci\u003E Follow Larry Fitzmaurice on \u003Ca

This is possibly how people can develop fetishized porn interests like with cartoons (a very popular search term), inanimate objects, and authority figures.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EEroticization could explain why a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpubmed\u002F7844025\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Enegative experience might become sexy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E later on. Maybe you were harshly shamed for masturbation as a teen, and now you find shaming a turn on. Maybe you were spanked as a child, and now you want that when you climax. Many believe that the reason you find something attractive can say a lot about hidden experiences you should explore.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"I have a client who's a cross dresser who'd been in a heterosexual relationship his entire life. But he's really turned on when he's watching crossdressing porn, and he's really disturbed by it because he doesn't get it, and he doesn't want this to be part of his life,\" she says. \"I gave him the choice to decide do we want to eliminate it?

Something that's exciting for many people is simply the idea of getting something you're not supposed to have, or something that is not available for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"Dopamine, this chemical we associate with reward and motivation, is actually higher when you anticipate pleasure than when you actually receive pleasure,\" she says. \"So the wanting is more exciting than the getting.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThis is another explanation for why MILF porn is so popular among heterosexuals. Instead of the theory that you're eroticizing your relationship to your mother, (yikes) what you might really be doing is getting excited by the sense of control and being with someone more experienced.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EO'Reilly believes that we have core erotic feelings—emotions that we need to feel in order to simply get in the mood and to get to more intense feelings and climax.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"We need to acknowledge that porn is a sexual experience, but it also has to do with emotional fulfillment. It's the reason if you can think of it, there's a porn of it,\" she says. \"It's not about the sex, you could watch sex all day long today if you want, but you want some sort of a feeling attached to it.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EBut if you go to a clinical psychologist, sex therapist, and author of \u003Ci\u003E Ethical Porn for Dicks\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, Dr. David Ley, he'll tell you something completely different. One research concept he introduced to the mix is how evolution plays a role in our sexual desires. He used it to explain why we might be drawn to cucking—when men watch their wives have sex with other men.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003ELey says that the reason someone would be turned on by this is because of our history of mate guarding. The jealousy of competing with another man's sexuality that creates a type of sexual excitement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EOther research points toward something closer to home.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"The research shows that people like these fantasies more as a reflection of who they are. We need to acknowledge right now that an awful lot of those characteristics are driven by genetics,\" he says. \"I have run into a great many couples and individuals who are engaging in a certain lifestyle, and then they find out that their parents were into it, too.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EUltimately, though, Ley says the dirty secret (author's note: his words, not mine) among researchers is that no one really has the answer to why we like the porn we do. We can answer simple questions with all sorts of theories but in the end, no one can tell you for sure why you orgasm as what you do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"The best answer probably is that it means nothing and everything,\" he says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EFor Costa, she says she tells her clients that as long as you're not hurting yourself or others and you are practicing consent, your porn consumption is all good.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"We don't know it and we can't control it, that is the interesting part about it, and that's why I don't judge it.

In India, where the people and the media often struggle to exercise their freedom of expression, he is inspiring millennials to speak up without fear. The 26-year-old runs an online citizen-media platform called \u003Ci\u003E Youth Ki Awaaz\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, which means \"the voice of youth\" in Hindi. What began as a personal blog when he was 17 years old has transformed into a full-fledged startup with a team of 26 people. Open letters written by young people on the platform's website have sparked social media campaigns and helped to shape local and national-party manifestos.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E The website attracts 2 million people every month, and almost 95 percent of its content—a mix of personal stories and opinions on movies, social issues, and government policies—is user generated. Tewari's team works around the clock to vet submissions and edit them for clarity. Readers have contributed more than 20,000 posts since the platform's inception in 2008.

But the media is structured in an extremely top-down and hierarchical manner. With any traditional media setup, whether it is a college newspaper or a national television channel, a few editors run the entire outlet. They decide who writes for them and who doesn't, and that leaves so many people out. I felt the need for something that is more bottom-up. I wanted to create a community of people who can write about issues in a journalistic way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E You've talked about the culture of silence in India. What is it, and why is it harmful?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EAs young people in India, we are never encouraged to speak up or question norms. We grow up in a culture of silence: Don't question your elders, don't speak up against traditions, and don't take risks. If young people do not question or break taboos and stereotypes, we are not going to progress. We are going to be where we were 50 years ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E Everyone on the internet has an opinion. Have you wondered if you're just creating more armchair activists?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThe internet is a mirror of everything offline. What you cannot say offline, you can say on the internet because you have the garb of anonymity, or you have a safer space. A single conversation on social media can trigger a full movement. Look at the Arab Spring; people were able to organize protests because they were able to create Facebook pages and tweet about where they were. So this \"armchair activism\" has actually become one of the biggest drivers for young people to go offline and do something. So think of the internet as a space to tell stories. If you tell the right stories to trigger the right emotions, you can get people to act—and they act offline.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003E \"If young people do not question or break taboos and stereotypes, we are not going to progress.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIs there an example that shows Youth Ki Awaaz has had tangible impact?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThe Happy to Bleed campaign is an example. The head of Sabarimala temple, a Hindu place of worship in Kerala, said that they should install machines to check whether women are menstruating or not. If they are, they shouldn't be allowed inside the premises. One of our readers, Nikita Azad, wrote an open letter on Youth Ki Awaaz directed toward the head about how he was encouraging menstrual taboos and how women have suffered for centuries because of them. That's how the movement really started. Women went on social media and posted their pictures with placards saying happy to bleed. The campaign helped propel conversations about menstrual taboos into the mainstream-media narrative in India.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E But the temple still doesn't allow menstruating women to enter.

The world is built for able-bodied people by able-bodied people. So nobody cares about this issue. But within a week of her story going up, 20,000 people had shared it. The company took note. And they immediately got the toilets—not just on her floor but in the entire building—reconstructed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E Youth Ki Awaaz posts articles as soon as they are submitted.

If I face a problem [on the train] in the Delhi Metro today, I want to talk about it today—not three days from now. Reasons why platforms like Snapchat and Instagram work are because you can put something up and instantly know whether people like it or not. So we decided to trust our community and open the platform up.

Illegal Big Cats of Instagram","body":"Buying illegal wild animals in Kuwait is, as one local puts it, \"as easy as acquiring a cupcake.\" Pets have long been used as status symbols the world over, but citizens of the Gulf take the prize when it comes to keeping the most exotic, controversial species—most commonly, \"big cat\" cubs. International law governing Kuwait and other Gulf states forbids the import and sale of wild animals, yet the sight of supercars being driven around with a cheetah in the front seat is starting to become commonplace on Arab Instagram feeds. Although there are legal ways to bring an animal into Kuwait, paying people off along the way is easier. Lion, cheetah, and tiger cubs are in the highest demand, fetching up to $15,000 each through black market agents. More often than not, the owners have little idea how to care for these creatures, which have no history of domestication and quickly become unmanageable—even lethal—once they're fully grown. In Big Cats of the Gulf, VICE investigates the area's flourishing trade in animal trafficking and how it impacts the depleting wildcat populations of Central and East Africa. We gain exclusive access to Kuwait's biggest Instagram star of the big cat phenomenon and hear first-hand of the deadly consequences of the business—both for the animals and their owners.","dek":"VICE

In 2013, Measham—along with drum 'n' bass DJ Wilf Gregory—founded a drug-harm-reduction NGO group called the Loop, which made international headlines last summer when it conducted the UK's first front-of-house drug testing (MAST) at UK music festivals like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vice.com\u002Fen_au\u002Farticle\u002Fdrug-testing-at-secret-garden-party\"\u003ESecret Garden Party\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and Kendal Calling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThis year, its reach is even wider: The ink hasn't quite dried on all the contracts, but the Loop will be providing drug testing at four or five commercial festivals. Add up all the guests at these events, and Fiona believes some 500,000 people will have access to a potentially lifesaving service. All this is a result of consultations with police and local authorities, as opposed to government officials, with permission being granted at a local rather than national level.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe Loop's presence at festivals last year was a breakthrough moment for all those who have spent years fighting to steer UK drug policy away from its traditional reliance on abstinence and criminal justice and toward a focus on public health and harm reduction. This shift is clearly much needed, as the stats show the government's current approach is bearing rotten fruit: A record 3,674 drug deaths were recorded in 2015, with 57 people dying after taking ecstasy—a result, in large part, of increased purity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"Changing national policy is like turning an oil tanker around, but we were impatient, knowing every year people are dying,\" says Measham over the phone. \"National policy might take years and years to change, but drug deaths are going up.

She was an early starter, going to her first club when she was 13. By 15, she was working behind the bar and hitchhiking down to London's Marquee Club to watch the Specials. \"We'd hitch a ride at \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSpaghetti_Junction\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESpaghetti Junction\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, sneak into the club while they were sound-checking so we didn't have to pay, then hitchhike back,\" she remembers. \"By the time we got back to Birmingham, milk had been delivered, so we'd take a couple of bottles for breakfast before school.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe effect on her education couldn't have been too detrimental: Measham's day job is now professor of criminology at Durham University. As an academic, she's spent her career exploring the relationship between dance music and drugs, and co-authored the first British academic study on the topic: \u003Ci\u003EDancing on Drugs: Risk, Health, and Hedonism in the British Club Scene\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. She thinks coming from an academic background has helped in her seemingly infinite meetings with police, public health officials, and local authorities in her work with the Loop. \"As a professor of criminology, I'm not seen as automatically 'on the other side',\" she says, \"like I might if I was a drugs worker with dreadlocks and a Bob Marley T-shirt. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThose meetings are becoming ever more regular since last summer's successful drug testing pilots; hardly a surprise when you consider the stats from Secret Garden Party. Across two days, the Loop—run entirely by volunteers, the majority of them doctors and chemistry professors, with NHS nurses on hand to offer harm-reduction advice—tested more than 250 people's drugs. The results have been well reported: A quarter of people gave their drugs back, mostly put off by adulterants their drugs were cut with. For instance, crushed-up malaria tablets parading as ketamine and ecstasy pills composed of concrete. Critics fear that offering drug testing will normalize the idea of drug taking at clubs and festivals. Beyond missing the fact that it's already very normalized, with the evidence at hand, it's hard to argue that providing a service aimed at taking bad drugs out of people's hands is in any way a negative thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe NGO also conducts back-of-house testing at Manchester's Warehouse Project, where seized drugs are tested and any notably dangerous narcotics flagged up on the club's social media. It'll be doing the same at Manchester's Albert Hall and giving quarterly onsite harm-reduction advice at Fabric, where it has been training up management to deliver in-house harm-reduction welfare. (Speaking of Fabric, Measham was the expert witness in the successful appeal against its closure.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThings have come a long way since Measham moved to Manchester in 1991. The city was one focal point of the UK's rave scene, and a colleague of hers had set up the Rave Research Bureau. Measham was an assistant on the project, which sought to understand, from the dance floor up, the UK's biggest countercultural movement since punk. \"I went to the Hacienda and Sankeys, and of course, I loved it,\" she says. \"But I was never really taken by that house scene. Then, in May 1993, I went with some friends to a club playing jungle music, and that was the one for me: I knew within two minutes of walking in.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIf jungle was Fiona's passion then, now it's keeping people safe when they're taking drugs.

Twitter adopted this same heart-shaped system in 2015, while, in the years since, Silicon Valley has come up with a multitude of new ways to gamify our need for social validation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495075659357-sm-addictioon-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003EFormer Google designer and ethicist \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.tristanharris.com\u002Fessays\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETristan Harris\u003C\u002Fa\u003E lays out the most common ways we're being manipulated on his blog. And as he explains, all of them use something called intermittent variable rewards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to understand this term is by imagining a slot machine. You pull the lever to win a prize, which is an intermittent action linked to a variable reward. Variable meaning you might win, or you might not. In the same way, you refresh your Facebook updates to see if you've won. Or you swipe right on Tinder to see if you've won.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThis is the most obvious way social feedback drives platform engagement, but others are harder to spot.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EYou know when you open Instagram or Twitter and it takes a few moments to load updates? That's no accident. Again, the expectation is part of what makes intermittent variable rewards so addictive. This is because, without that three-second delay, Instagram wouldn't feel variable. There's no sense of \u003Ci\u003E will I win?\u003C\u002Fi\u003E because you'd know instantly. So the delay isn't the app loading. It's the cogs spinning on the slot machine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EAnother piece of psychology hijacked by social platforms is that of social reciprocity; if someone pats your back, you'll feel pressure to pat his or hers. Facebook exploits this by alerting you when someone has read your message, which encourages the receivers to respond—because they know you know they've read it. And at the same time, it encourages you to check back to read the inevitable response.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe same bits of your brain get a rush on Facebook as a set of wavy dots appear as someone writes a message. You might not exit if you think you're getting a message, or at the very least you're more likely to come back. And while Apple also employs this feature, at least it allows you to turn it off.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EAll this might seem a little underhanded, but it's nothing compared to some of the design features currently showing up on Snapchat. Of these is the one causing the most concern, and uses elongating red lines to display the number days of since two users interacted. According to Adam Alter, this design feature is so effective that he's heard of teens asking friends to babysit their streaks while on vacation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"It's clear here that the goal—keeping the streak alive—is more important than enjoying the platform as a social experience,\" he says. \"This is a clear sign that engagement mechanisms are driving usage more than enjoyment.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EWe asked like button co-creator Justin Rosenstein what he thinks is the most insidious form of social media manipulation, and according to him, it's the humble push notification.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"The vast majority of push notifications are just distractions that pull us out of the moment,\" he says. \"They get us hooked on pulling our phones out and getting lost in a quick hit of information that could wait for later, or doesn't matter at all.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, all these little efforts to keep us hooked are having a very real impact. As Facebook's current head of marketing bragged in\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fsocialmediaweek.org\u002Fnewyork\u002F2016\u002F05\u002F31\u002Fmillennials-check-phones-157-times-per-day\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E this speech\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, the average millennial checks his or her phone 157 times daily.

Today he's the co-founder of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fasana.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAsana\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a web and mobile app that helps teams track their work and manage projects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EBut according to author Adam Alter, change will only come from the bottom up. He claims the social media business model, built around the needs of marketing agencies instead of lives, are already far too entrenched and profitable for self-governing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"It might diminish a bit,\" he says. \"But as long as companies have an incentive to make their platforms as engaging as possible, the arms race forcing them to 'manipulate' users will continue.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EHe encourages users to try and curb their own addictions or to install \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.timewellspent.io\u002Ftake-control\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ephone apps that will do that for them\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

Like all good love affairs, it started exciting. We used to stay up late and laugh together, now it's just helping us to argue for longer. The long idle summers of Albino Black Sheep and Chris Crocker turned into a gray unceasing winter of big data billionaires and live-streamed tortures. We're under surveillance, unable to concentrate, we're not present, we can't sleep—we can't even cross the street anymore. It's the reason you can't finish a book and why department stores already know that you've been thinking about buying a Nutri-Bullet. Yet—like so many terrible relationships—despite all of the energy-sapping, data-mining exhaustion of it all, we can't quit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003EWhat's worse is: we know all this. You hardly need another book, another inflamed headline, another podcast to detail the multitude of ways in which your phone is ruining your life. Yet despite all that, we only seem capable of taking the conversation halfway. We've diagnosed the problem, but for a generation that prides itself on being \"woke, of course, \" we've been surprisingly nonplussed about coming up with a solution to what is surely the most universally pervasive issue of our lifetime.\u003Cp\u003EWe've failed to address the problem mostly because we don't know where to start. As we see it, the internet is like a life support system. Deciding one day to pull it from our veins would leave us gasping frantically before plunging into an endless, lonely abyss. We can't return to a world without it, and to remove ourselves from the world \u003Ci\u003E with\u003C\u002Fi\u003E it—by becoming Amish—feels like a stretch. We could delete all of our accounts, but how would we find out if we've been invited to get birthday drinks?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe continuation of the current slide is not inevitable. After all, the iPhone is only a decade old, and the worldwide web only 25. What we've broadly come to consider as the beginning of a decline could equally turn out to be a period of technological naivety—the time before we truly grasped what we were prepared to sacrifice and what we wanted in return. Tech, of course, shapes the future, but it's also totally conceivable that a struggle to redefine the role it plays in our lives will take place.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003ESmall but meaningful changes are already taking place. Policy-makers are \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.telegraph.co.uk\u002Feducation\u002Feducationnews\u002F11861301\u002FMobile-phones-and-iPads-could-be-banned-from-classrooms.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Edebating\u003C\u002Fa\u003E whether or not smartphones have a place in the classroom, restaurants are \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.independent.co.uk\u002Fnews\u002Fuk\u002Fhome-news\u002Fjapanese-restaurant-auradaze-bans-customers-from-using-mobile-phones-a6816586.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ebanning them\u003C\u002Fa\u003E at dinner tables and businesses are demanding they stay out of meetings. The battle between music venues and smartphones is a long and storied one—notably tech company Yondr have even created phone cases which lock once people enter the venue's designated \"phone-free zone.\" As of March this year, driving while texting will cost the driver a $250 fine and six points on their license in the UK. All across public life, the assumed omnipresence of technology is being challenged.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIndividually, we've been addressing it as well. The idea of a \"digital detox\" dates back to the days of the Blackberry. Classically they're centered around idyllic, phone-free retreats, but most organizations also promote ways of building a positive relationship with technology in the real world. When I contacted Tanya Goodin, founder of the digital detox organization \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.itstimetologoff.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETime To Log Off\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, about her retreats, she said they were similar to other kinds of rehab: People know they've got a problem and want help. \"At the end, when we give them their phones back, there's always one person who says they don't want it,\" she says, laughing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003ECrucial to their success is how digital detoxes have married the spheres of technology and the burgeoning wellness industry. With the rise in popularity of mindfulness apps like Headspace, the fashionability of meditation has brought with it a keen interest in the benefits of going phone-free. There are now—somewhat ironically—a wealth of apps designed to help people use their phones and computers productively—from Self Control, which allows you to block certain websites for a certain amount of time, to Stay On Task, which simply nudges you to check that you're getting on with whatever it is you're supposed to be doing. Silicon Valley has led the way elsewhere, pioneering the idea of a literal \"Digital Sabbath\"—insisting employees take a day of technology-free rest on the weekend.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIndividually these policies, trends, and fads don't amount to much of a revolution. Yet they point to a potential. So far they are disparate ideas, hanging threads waiting for a broader intellectual movement to collect them. Yet the blueprints are there for that as well. Making a big deal about leaving Facebook used to be the preserve of high school art students who stayed offline so nothing could distract them from listening to introspective acoustic guitar music on their parents' record player.Yet, increasingly, as ideas of technology addiction have become normal topics of conversation—as publications ranging from the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fsociety\u002F2017\u002Fapr\u002F08\u002Fteenagers-loneliness-social-media-isolation-parents-attention\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E \u003Ci\u003EGuardian\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003C\u002Fa\u003E to \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.breitbart.com\u002Fbig-government\u002F2016\u002F04\u002F30\u002Fmillennials-use-social-media-linked-depression\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBreitbart\u003C\u002Fa\u003E have reported on the links between social media and loneliness—leaving social networks, temporarily or for good, has become a more conventional decision for young people to take.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIf \"I'm not on Facebook\" used to be a hipsterism, it increasingly looks set to become a mainstream concern. By 2013 the number of adults who said they'd taken extended or permanent breaks from Facebook sat at around 61 percent. As Facebook continues to raise eyebrows over its privacy policies, the ground for a continuing exodus grows more fertile. It's totally plausible, if not logical, to see how quickly leaving social media could be adopted by some as a counterculture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E \u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E \u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E \u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E \u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E \u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E \u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1494932620886-detoxgood.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E \u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E \u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Cp class=\"article__text--dropcap\"\u003EThere is a transgressive quality to being a young person in 2017 and turning your back on your phone. In his book \u003Ci\u003E Solitude\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, Canadian writer Michael Harris positions living without the constant distraction of notifications as a spiritual awakening waiting to happen. He defines internal thought as an art; a discipline that needs to be cultivated in a world figured against it. \"Radical is the word,\" he tells me over Skype. \"You have to be comfortable with a certain quality of rudeness if you're going to remove yourself from group culture.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EHarris' book isn't preachy; rather, it recasts small lifestyle changes as part of a struggle to regain that sense of self. For example, Harris tells me, he pushes back the moment he first checks his phone, giving himself as long as possible at the start of the day before entering the cloud. It's a small gesture, but it's the sort of practical change that points to how control can be regained. \"These are the ways we have to curate our hours,\" he explains. \"I think it's indicative of the level of addiction we're stuck with. You can't just go on a digital detox and then be fixed. We're so marinated in this, we have to struggle against it on a daily if not hourly basis.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIt speaks to a long overdue conversation we still haven't properly had in our society—one which understands that cultivating a healthy relationship with your phone is as important as using condoms or eating your greens. \"If you look at the 1950s and 1960s food culture in North America, there was this super-abundance of food,\" Harris continues, \"but we weren't smart about how we ate, and then as diabetes and obesity levels shot up we had to stop and think. In the same way, we're not going to eat Kraft dinner every night for the rest of our lives, we are starting to say: What's a healthy media diet?\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EWhat's required for that to happen is for people to start thinking about technology use as a public health issue—and is that really so hard to imagine? Campaigners are already fighting to make mental health education compulsory in UK schools; managing compulsive social media use is surely a logical extension of this. You only need to look at the increasing popularity of mindfulness exercises in British schools to see how effective ideas of wellness can prove.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EDr. Richard Graham is a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Around 12 years ago he began dealing with unprecedented cases of young people suffering from mental health issues as a result of excessive technology use. In 2010 he launched the UK's first specialist service for technology addiction, and in the years since he has become a leading expert on dependency and rehabilitation. When I speak to him over the phone, he agrees our relationship with technology is problematic but is less sure we've reached a breaking point. \"I don't think we know what our limits are yet,\" he explains. \"I started out in the era of a single platform. Now it's wearables. It's so entwined, it's far more complex.\"\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EHe believes current generations have to think seriously about our future relationship with technology. That said, he doesn't think abstinence is the way forward, rather that the focus should be on equipping the next generation to \"develop the internet in an ethical way.\" However, he agrees that a cultural shift in some form is likely. \"I expect we'll see tribes who go down that route,\" he suggests, \"parents seeking schools where the iPad in the nursery is withheld.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe argument, of course, goes that these ideas have been about for a while now. Digital detox getaways have so far failed to ignite any meaningful societal change. Convincing people that using Twitter too often isn't good for them is unlikely to spark a reaction of any substance. Up until fairly recently, the damage was quantified as personal—fears of using your phone too much related to your own wellbeing. Yet the context is changing. From high-profile intelligence leaks to revelations of widespread data-mining, our obsessive relationship with screens has suddenly taken on a political dimension. Suggestions of smartphones \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.co.uk\u002Fnews\u002Ftechnology-35639549\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Elistening in on conversations\u003C\u002Fa\u003E have become commonplace rumor and \"fake news\" has entered our vernacular. Gradually a distrust of technology has transitioned from the dystopic to the everyday.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EWhether it's been used in connection with Brexit, or simply to sell car insurance, the exploitation of our data has exposed just how frighteningly unregulated the internet is. Corporations know what you want to buy before you've even googled it, and governments are able to build intimate pictures of their citizens, either directly or by outsourcing to private surveillance companies. Whatever we thought we were agreeing to when we created our Facebook accounts, it surely wasn't this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003E\"We're setting ourselves up for a place where there's no regulation and no oversight and there's no discussion. We're not choosing, at all.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp class=\"article__text--dropcap\"\u003EManoush Zomorodi is the host and managing editor of \u003Ci\u003E Note to Self\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, a podcast self-described as the \"tech show about being human.\" She recognizes our current situation as a state of mass paralysis, a strange unspoken collective sense that something bad is happening but we don't \u003Ci\u003E really \u003C\u002Fi\u003Eknow what we can do about it. \"We love having the convenience of living online, but we hate the feeling that we have no say over where our personal information goes, or who is looking at it, so we just feel kind of gross most of the time,\" she explains during a conversation over Skype. \"We click yes to some terms of service and think. 'I'm a terrible person, I didn't read them,' or, 'I did, but I clicked yes anyway.' How did we get to the point where in order to download an app you have this moment where you feel like a bad person?\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThat compromise, that pact, is what Zomorodi calls the \"privacy paradox.\" It's the name of a project \u003Ci\u003E Note to Self\u003C\u002Fi\u003E launched earlier this year that sought to equip their listeners with the tools and information to reclaim their personal privacy in a world where, as it stands, both corporations and governments have unfettered access to everything. \"We're setting ourselves up for a place where there's no regulation and no oversight,\" Zomorodi continues, \"and there's no discussion. We're not choosing here, at all.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003ELike \u003Ci\u003E Solitude\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, The Privacy Paradox project offers the practical first steps towards resolving a larger problem. \"It was shocking for me that people didn't know that each app has its own privacy settings,\" Zomorodi tells me. \"One guy who contacted us was like, 'Holy shit, I had no idea that my flashlight app was collecting my location, had access to my microphone, and all of my contacts!' Then you ask, why was it free, or 99 cents? Well, probably because it is selling all of its users' data to marketers.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EWhat's surprised Zomorodi the most is just how many people are ready for these ideas, and how quickly they can catch on when communicated effectively. As soon as people see their data as something they can influence, they want to demand more from social networks and governments who are currently operating in a totally unregulated digital sphere. \"It's a cultural shift that needs to happen—zit requires us to be not OK with this en masse,\" she tells me. \"You have to start somewhere. A little bit of autonomy. So we're starting with conversations, little things, deleting apps.\" And it's working. Zomorodi initially predicted somewhere in the region of 200 people would sign up for the project. The first wave attracted 20,000.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIt's this dimension that signals the real potential of a future backlash. The more social networks, governments, and corporations are shown to be complicit in manipulation, the less desirable possessing a Facebook account becomes. Politicizing our relationship with technology will most likely prove the most effective way of changing it. Encrypted messaging services like Signal might not seem interesting now, but position them as tools with which minorities can protect themselves in Trump's America, or methods for avoiding May's \"Snoopers Charter,\" in the UK and they take on powerful new meanings—suddenly an unheard-of app becomes a source of anti-establishment empowerment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe seeds for this are already being sown—in the reactions against Facebook's sharing of users' moods with companies. As the world begins to further question the role technology has played in recent campaign shocks, and more generally how excessive internet use has facilitated a voluntary surveillance state, it seems inevitable that people will begin to question whether it's worth it for the group chat.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Chr\u003E \u003Cp\u003ELISTEN: The VICE Podcast – Can You Cure Your Social Media Addiction?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cdiv data-iframely-id=\"I7lEBro\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 400px; position: relative;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003E\u003Ciframe data-iframely-url=\"\u002F\u002Foembed.vice.com\u002FI7lEBro?playerjs=true\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Chr\u003E \u003Cp class=\"article__text--dropcap\"\u003EWhere we're at now feels a bit like where vegetarianism was a couple of generations ago. Experts were beginning to tell us meat was bad for our bodies and bad for our environments, but we ate so much of it that we struggled to envisage life without it. Then, slowly but surely, with each tofu meatless product and every violent documentary, vegetarianism became a counterculture. Given the mental and ethical ramifications of our current relationship with technology, similar developments are totally plausible. If anything, we should find it easier; it's not like we've been battling with centuries of meat-eating. We've been at this for less than 20 years.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EOr take smoking. Only a generation ago you could have smoked a cigarette in Pizza Hut. Now, it's unlikely many people would smoke in their own cars. It's been a slow process of education and persuasion, but ultimately our culture changed. The materials for a healthy relationship with technology are there also. Just as smoking indoors was the beginning of the end, who's to say penalties for driving while texting won't spark an interest in how we can influence the interplay between technology and public life?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003ELike all countercultures, unplugging will probably start small and meaningful, and end up being sold by the very corporations it set out to rebel against. Like McDonald's making salads, Facebook is already curating news-outlets, guaranteeing authenticity in response to the \"fake news\" dilemma.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EZomorodi is confident about the future, simply due to the reception her podcast continues to receive. \"I think people are looking for a community,\" she explains. \"They are looking for permission. They want to understand it. To me, this is the future of digital literacy. It's not about learning how to code; it's about learning how these very powerful tools are changing how we exist culturally.\"\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EMany writers have already hypothesized a neo-Luddite reaction to the automation of industry. Writing for the \u003Ci\u003ENew Statesman\u003C\u002Fi\u003E in 2014, Bryan Appleyard saw \"Luddism in practice and in theory\" as \"back on the streets\", tracing a lineage from the American anarchist Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, to the hands of the Parisian taxi drivers who vandalized Uber vehicles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIn 2013, economist Paul Krugman wrote an article titled \"Sympathy for the Luddites\" for the \u003Ci\u003ENew York Times\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, connecting the textile workers of 19th century Leeds with the labor forces of today who are facing a future of increasing redundancy as automation comes to play an increasingly central role in production—something George Monbiot has also recently explored with regards to education.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe conflict between labor and technology is considered by many an inevitability, yet in a world of data-mining and technology addiction, where the lines between producer and consumer are becoming increasingly blurred, the need to conceive of a socio-cultural equivalent of this tension becomes more pressing. This isn't about saying \"technology is bad.\" Rather, it's influencing the ways in which it develops—democratizing progress, so to speak.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThis isn't a speculation that the people will one day rise up and throw their phones in the bin. This backlash probably won't take the form of Apple Stores being smashed to pieces by Politics students, or tech-free cults establishing settlements in the Lake District. Truthfully, it might not happen at all. Yet, it seems reasonable to assume that the more these ideas grow in the collective consciousness—the more people realize exactly what they've sacrificed in exchange for convenience—the more likely they are to indulge that most popular of rebellious reflexes, and take back control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EFollow Angus Harrison on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fa_n_g_u_s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETwitter.\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vice.com\u002Fen_us\u002Farticle\u002Fwhat-the-digital-resistance-movement-might-look-like","summary":null,"suggested_tweet":null,"dek":"We all know technology is making us miserable but haven't worked out a solution.

1984, which set into motion a change in how the mainstream media covered LGBTQ culture. That shift came with the release of two pivotal songs, Bronski Beat's \"Small Town Boy\" and Frankie Goes to Hollywood's \"Relax\"—tracks, Flynn says, that both answered the questions of what it means to be a gay man. One, the internal struggle; the other, the external life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"My brother's reaction to those songs were not the same as mine were,\" says Flynn now.

Talking to members of Parliament, Kylie and Chris Smith, as well as TV producers, music-industry heads, and magazine editors, the book is an important milestone in understanding the journey of how gay culture moved from George Michaels's leather-gloved-disco-ball-in-the-bogs and conga'd out the other side, to 2017. A year where even my dad knows what Grindr is, and being gay, for the most part, is just really, really normal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EWATCH: Out and Bad – London's LGBT Dancehall Scene\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv data-iframely-id=\"QJUCNTa\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003E\u003Ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"\u002F\u002Foembed.vice.com\u002FQJUCNTa\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EVICE: What was happening to you in 1984?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPaul Flynn:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E In 1984, I was living in South Manchester, England, in a semi-detached house, and I turned 13 years old—a teenager. I was absolutely obsessed with \u003Ci\u003ESmash Hits\u003C\u002Fi\u003E magazine. They only had three copies in the newsagents over the road, and I always bought the first one. I was at school in Wythenshawe. I've always wondered why I'm not just gay, but really gay—I've worked in gay clubs, on a gay magazine; the first job I ever had was at \u003Ci\u003EManchester City Life\u003C\u002Fi\u003E as the gay and lesbian editor. I really embraced gayness in a way that was outside of just myself; I was interested in it culturally. And I think the reason behind that is because when I became a teenager, in 1984, it was the most amazingly gay year in Britain. It was something that I was attuned to. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always loved New Order; they would talk about going to gay clubs. It was the year after \"Blue Monday\" came out, so they had been incubating this idea of what a gay club was. It was very glamorous and New York; even at a very early age, I knew about clubs like the Pyramid or Danceteria. So there was this netherworld I was drawn to, one, culturally, but two—not that I would have dared to say it at the time—for deeper reasons.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIt's funny when something just talks to you and you don't know why.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EOr you do know why, and you're not ready to accept why, or you don't have the vocabulary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EYou get the codified symbols without knowing.

I've always known that pop culture seemed to move the gay conversation so much quicker than the Establishment. Obviously religion was against it, and school also didn't acknowledge it—other than one embarrassing sex ed lesson about how anal sex was an impossibility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ESome gays do love pop culture.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EYes, and I think it can cushion the gay experience.

I wanted to speak to a younger version of myself, who didn't have the UK drama \u003Ci\u003EBrideshead Revisited\u003C\u002Fi\u003E as a pop-culture reference, but who knew what was happening on TV and in clubs. You always heard the best conversations in gay clubs, and that never seemed to be reflected in the mainstream media. There was something rawer and readier than gay culture that didn't get a look in until the show \u003Ci\u003EQueer as Folk\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, really.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1493378084059-Goodasyou.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1493378084059-Goodasyou.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1493378084059-Goodasyou.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1493378084059-Goodasyou.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1493378084059-Goodasyou.jpeg?resize=795:*\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1493378084059-Goodasyou.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003EThe front and back covers of \u003Ci\u003EGood As You\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWho do you want to read \u003Ci\u003EGood As You,\u003C\u002Fi\u003E and what do you want them to take away from it?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThe absolute target audience is people of my age and disposition.

It's one thing remembering, and it's another committing that person to paper. I've tried to be as free as possible, but it was really interesting. There was a point that came back to me. I was being inducted for a job in a record shop. I was 18 years old, and I had just finished my final exams. It was in Piccadilly Gardens, in Manchester, England. In my head, the idea of working in a record shop felt so exciting. So we were in this regional meeting, and it was really boring and talking about smoking regulations, and in the middle of it, this guy said, \"Let's learn about you. What record did you last buy?\" Everyone was \"that type\"—loves the Stone Roses, mid-90s Manchester man. I was like, the last record I bought was a $3.00 Kylie Minogue's \u003Ci\u003EEnjoy Yourself\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. At this point, I was well on my journey as a gay, but admitting that was in effect coming out. Everyone was going on about REM and Husker Dü. There was a lad opposite me who had a big blond pompadour and a biker jacket, and he started talking about the composer Diamanda Galas. I was like, if he can do it, I can do it.

For the book, I approached David. I felt his was a story that people didn't know.

That in turn can dramatically increase erosion, habitat destruction, river diversion, and forest fragmentation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"It can pollute the lands and waters in the areas where it's cultivated, as well as poison wildlife through the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and petroleum fuels,\" Carah said. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Chemicals are often used to kill woodrats and other small rodents that can damage the crop. Unfortunately, these rodenticides can make their way into the food chain and pose significant risks to predators. Carah said that in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theatlantic.com\u002Fscience\u002Farchive\u002F2017\u002F03\u002Fbackcountry-drug-war\u002F521352\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECalifornia's public lands\u003C\u002Fa\u003E they put the rare Pacific fisher and northern spotted owl in serious danger. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Legalizing and regulating could help mitigate such issues.

In addition, the state's legalization initiative dedicates 20 percent of tax revenue to preventing environmental impacts and cleaning up environmental impacts of the past.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Over time, there will also be the possibility of Canadian growers tapping into government-led energy-efficiency programs and investing in energy-saving technologies such as LED grow lights, as well as plenty of research and development to reduce costs. That could also include proper enforcement of building codes and product labeling. The 2012 journal article estimated that energy usage could be cut by at least 75 percent by applying \"cost-effective, commercially available efficiency improvements.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E There's also the potential for rural economic development that will replace jobs lost in the national phase out of coal-fired power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"However we can figure out how to bring this under the guise of an environmentally regulatory framework has got to be a good thing because there's a lot of potential there,\" Brenner said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E But let's be real. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Smoking marijuana has some environmental downsides.

She says that in late 2015, the then-15-year-old had sex with a 12-year-old girl alongside two adults—his 23-year-old cousin Barajas and a 27-year-old professional skateboarder named Keelan Dadd—in exchange for an appearance in a non-existent upcoming MTV special. He's been charged with having sexual contact with a minor and rape, according to Toosbuy, and his case is a particularly significant one in a society where the line between celebrity and civilian has become muddled and the barriers of communication between the two have essentially evaporated. What's more, Fernandez's is a cautionary tale about the lack of protection afforded socioeconomically disadvantaged kids who go viral.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EAsk any of Fernandez's young fans what they think about the charges and they'll tell you the alleged victim just wanted attention. His family, for their part, stands behind him too. His great-aunt Marisela, who is also the mother of codefendant Barajas, serves as a guardian of sorts and never misses a performance.\u003Cb\u003E \u003C\u002Fb\u003EFernandez himself says he's been falsely accused. Initially, the LAPD claimed that his behavior was so psychologically sophisticated that the district attorney's office should charge him as an adult. Meanwhile, Fernandez's attorney \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newsweek.com\u002Fsteven-fernandez-fearing-more-victims-police-release-name-teen-youtube-406704\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehas claimed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that the child star was himself a victim.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EAccidental fame is difficult even for adults, something I learned early in my time with Fernandez.

According to LAPD Detective Ninette Toosbuy, he's a predator the likes of which she's never seen in her 14 years working the sex crimes unit. During a visit to her office in Reseda, she explained how the parents of a 12-year-old girl found messages from the teenager on their daughter's phone and brought her in for questioning. The girl then recounted how the child star—who was 15 at the time—had lured her into a car where he promised introductions to celebrities in return for sexual favors. The cop told me that Fernandez, Barajas, and Dadd later met her at an abandoned house for consensual sex, although no plans to introduce her to any stars existed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Then, in November 2015, the LAPD conducted a sting by pretending to be the same young girl and asking Fernandez to meet up at that same abandoned house. This time, only Fernandez and his cousin showed up. Both were arrested, and two weeks later, skater Keelan Dadd turned himself over to investigators. This sex-for-fame scheme, Toosbuy says, had been going on for years, and all three cases are still in pre-trial proceedings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, people who know Fernandez spin a much different tale—one of a child born to Mexican immigrants in one of LA's roughest neighborhoods who inadvertently hit it big as a teenage sex symbol.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EPublic records detailing his early life are scant, and his mother, Rosa Esparza, declined to speak to reporters citing instructions from a lawyer. However, the story that Fernandez's great-aunt Marisela tells me begins with his parents coming to the United States from south Juárez, Mexico, about two decades ago after losing a fortune in the hospitality industry. Standing in front of her Escalade after the rap show in Fresno, she explained in Spanish that after settling into Compton, on the border of South Central, Fernandez's father, Jamie, sold cars while his mother, Rosa, stayed at home.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EFernandez grew up alongside three brothers—Jamie, Jose, and Alex—and a younger sister, Jackie, but first moved in with his great-aunt Marisela, his grandmother, and his cousin, Luis Barajas, at the age of nine. That's also when he was gifted his first skateboard by his grandmother. He preferred the two-story home with a pool to his parent's two-room apartment behind a restaurant storefront, but ping-ponged between the two places throughout his childhood.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\"My grandmother loved him so much, and my mom wanted her to be happy, so she had a room set up for Steven and my grandmother,\" his aunt Keiko tells me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThat grandmother would be the first of many adults—whether they be extended family members, skaters, managers, or fellow entertainers—to step into his life and provide the support he apparently lacked in Compton.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EBy the age of 11, Fernandez was good enough at skating to have sponsors sending him gear, like Primitive Skateboards and eventually Dirty Ghetto Kids (DGK).

He grabs the breasts of a mannequin and stumbles upon a mysterious woman twerking upside down, a preview of the conduct that eventually made him a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=IyXDgh7em8s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ebonafide YouTube star\u003C\u002Fa\u003E capable of garnering millions of views per video.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe video was a crucial breakthrough in Fernandez's career, even if he still wasn't making any real money. While he showed promise, his aunt and others say he lacked the talent to immediately go pro, and much of his family viewed his love of the sport as less of a career than a hobby that might keep him out of trouble in a gang-infested neighborhood. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EFernandez says his career took a turn after he posted a photo of himself in front of a local 7-11 and noticed comments coming in from girls who said he was cute. (His aunt says that the switch came after an in-store event he did with DGK that brought in hoards of young women, at which point the company handlers started seeing dollar signs.) What's certain is that with the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=CX3mOsRtOKM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Erelease\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of \"How to Get Girls\"—an eight-minute video of Fernandez harassing women on the street, making rape jokes, and then posing with sexy adults—things changed for him and his family.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\"I know how you guys like booty, so I'm doing this thing called Instabooty of the week,\" Steven says in the video as he walks through the bedroom of Nikki Giavasis, an ex-cheerleader for the Houston Oilers.

Still, cultural mores haven't changed so much that public record of these kinds of behaviors could preclude someone from reaching the highest office in the country, as our president has shown, and they're considered even more excusable when performed by children.

I wish I could just gamble all day and get rich off that.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003ESadly for him, the promise of the high life seems to be receding. Fernandez's mom is still living in Compton across the street from the house where she raised her kids. Barajas is on the hook for at least $125,000 to a slick criminal defense attorney, and profits are dwindling for Fernandez, too, since co-manager Morales entered the mix. For instance, each of those adults got a 25 percent cut of the money made in Fresno. Fernandez's trial looms, but there's still plenty of time to make some cash before it happens at events like one that was \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fp\u002FBQmgIc4j1tf\u002F?taken-by=imlilcloud&hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eadvertised\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for in February (but ultimately \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fp\u002FBQ7JDW5DV3p\u002F?taken-by=imlilcloud&hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ecratered\u003C\u002Fa\u003E due to a permit issue) in which Scummys could fork over $115 to see Lil Cloud perform at a carnival and eat dinner with him after.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"He's got so many people in his ear, his cousin and people making money off of him that they're probably trying to figure out what's the next bread ticket,\" says Zolot. \"How can they make money off of him.\" \u003Cb\u003E \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Court documents pertaining to Fernandez (who turned 17 in February) aren't public record because he's a minor. But Detective Toosbuy with the LAPD explained that the legal argument for charging the \"How to Get Girls\" star with rape revolves around the fact that he allegedly used coercion to obtain sex, something that's been illegal for a long time but was typically just considered a \"woman problem\" in the past, according to Toosbuy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"In the case of Steven Fernandez, there were a lot of things told to these young girls,\" she told me. \"'If you don't have sex with me, it's not gonna be good for you.'

Toosbuy initially pushed prosecutors at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office––who told me they can't comment on open cases––to try him as an adult. Now that the possibility of trying him as an adult is off the table, since the offender would need to have been 16 at the time of his arrest, the LAPD has pivoted toward a public safety angle. Despite the fact that Fernandez was systematically rewarded for predatory behavior at a young age, Toosby claims he's a danger to society who should be kept away from the public.

Angels sergeant-at-arms  flipped on his club has he ever really felt at home. In a sad twist, the only people Atwell can ever truly talk to anymore are the ones he would have previously avoided like the plague—journalists and police officers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"Man, just being able to talk like this means the world to me,\" Atwell told me after calling my phone from a blocked number. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E That's the thing few people realize about the witness protection program: the fact that it goes arm in arm with an enduring loneliness. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Atwell is in the program after becoming an informant on the Hells Angels for the police in the late 2000s—he is the highest ranking member of the motorcycle club to do so. Atwell and veteran journalist Jerry Langton just released \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.harpercollins.ca\u002F9781443450386\u002Fthe-hard-way-out\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe Hard Way Out\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a novel that outlines his experiences with the club\u003Ci\u003E. \u003C\u002Fi\u003EIn the book, he talks about selling coke, patching (when a smaller gang is absorbed into a larger gang) from the Para-Dice Riders to the Hells Angels, becoming a full patch member, and how and why he flipped.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor seven years, Atwell was the sergeant-at-arms of the Toronto chapter, meaning that he doled out discipline and made sure that everything was on the straight and narrow. He was also integral in the HA's movement of coke around Toronto. When the respected Angel was hit with some drug charges, he decided he wanted out but quickly learned that it wouldn't be easy. When the charges were dismissed, he was expected to happily go back and work. After that, Atwell started to see the club and his brothers differently: The bikers and the Hells Angels weren't a family, they were \"all in it for themselves.\"\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"I was trapped, not by bars, but by the limitations the club had put on me and my life,\" reads a passage in his book.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E So Atwell took a deal that would allow him to escape the grip the club had on his life. He secretly recorded the happenings in his chapter and became instrumental in bringing down a massive drug operation. The operation came to an end after 18 months when the HA smelled a rat. This being the Hells Angels and all, they confronted Atwell and his handlers knew it was too dangerous to carry on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003E\"I was trapped, not by bars, but by the limitations the club had put on me and my life.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E The information Atwell acquired for the police led to 31 people with ties to the Hells Angels facing 169 charges (though not all of them stuck) and the seizure of $3 million in drugs, along with $500,000 in cash and another half a million in property. In trial after trial, for years, Atwell would make court appearances in which he would have to look his former brothers in the eyes during the day and get used to his new life in witness protection at night.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moment he flipped, the man Dave Atwell had lived as for almost 50 years was dead. Furthermore, the transition into the witness protection program wasn't going to be easy—his entire life was built around the patches he wore on his vest, and now they were gone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg?resize=1000:*\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829277056-Hells_Angels_logo.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003EThe Hells Angels patch.

The policies in the program are there to obviously protect the witness in question, but they're also making sure the program isn't liable if the witness in protection fucks up or reoffends. Atwell said it's \"weird talking about witness protection because there is so much to it that's interesting but that would be detrimental to my safety.\" One thing he did say was that when you first enter the program you lose any sort of control you had over your life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"The guys in witness protection, they're not asking you, they're telling you,\" Atwell explained. \"You got no say in it.

However, the one thing he could talk about is the intense loneliness that comes with his situation. In his personal life, Atwell either has to lie to everyone he meets or just completely obscure his past from their knowledge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"What can I do? I can only imagine getting close to someone,\" Atwell told me. \"If someone cares about someone, whether it's a friend, a platonic relationship, or an intimate one with the opposite sex, you can only go so far before that person who cares for you [asks] 'Well what happened before that? Where did you come from?' I can't share any of that with anyone.\" \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"If I cared about someone I'd like to know that. Not because I'm nosey, but because it's a general, caring-type thing—getting to know someone,\"he said. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E Beyond keeping his personal history from others, there is what Atwell calls the \"am I going to bring someone into this life?\" question. After all, the program is designed to not only protect the witnesses, but the lives of people close to them. In a cruel bit of irony, the fact these people care about others means they have to force themselves to never have someone they care about in their life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E So, because of this, Atwell lives a self-imposed life absent from any sort of intimacy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1490829488148-2874842-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003EA police officer stands in front of a raided Hells Angels clubhouse in Toronto in 2007.

But life doesn't always reward you when you decide to make the right decision. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \"The irony of life is that's all I've been looking for is a level of comfort and acceptance—whether it was with hockey, or with the club, or whether it was with a lady—a level of comfort,\" he says. \"The irony is that's all I wanted and I'll never have it.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E Some details in the quotes used have been changed or removed as not to give away Atwell's location. \u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003ELead image by Ralph Damman.\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ci\u003E Follow Mack Lamoureux on \u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fmacklamoureux\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETwitter.\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vice.com\u002Fen_us\u002Farticle\u002Flife-after-betraying-the-hells-angels","summary":null,"suggested_tweet":null,"dek":"We talked to Dave Atwell, the highest ranking member of the Hells Angels in history to flip on the club.

For one, it's just that the sheer number of insect species on Earth [is too high]. There's been over a million species of insects described, and to understand how the bulk of the species respond to something as complex as climate change is a challenge, and it's impossible with the amount of time, and the amount of researchers that are working on these.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003EOK I'll narrow it down: Will any bugs be physically different in the next few decades?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EWe've been studying the 17-year cicadas—really long-living insects that live in rural areas and cities. One thing that happens with a lot of insects is that they just grow bigger when it's warmer. So, we're actually finding changes in cicada size with urban warming. You could predict something similar might be happening as we have climate change, we might get bigger cicadas. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWill any bugs die off?\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe main thing that people have looked at is called the \"\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC3520015\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ecritical thermal maximum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\" That's really just the temperature at which a species goes into heatstroke. Humans get to a certain temperature go into heat stroke, and the same thing goes for insects. You can measure the temperature that an insect gets heat stroke for a whole bunch of species, and then make broad generalizations about how they might be impacted by warming. Unsurprisingly, there are species that can tolerate warmer temperatures, and they tend to do better in climate change. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECould you tell me about some of those sweeping generalizations?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EWhat we think will happen—and what is happening already—is that when it gets warmer, a species that can't tolerate the heat will either move north, or it's going to move up the slope of the mountain, where it's cooler. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EWatch: The hidden effects of climate change \u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cdiv data-iframely-id=\"8X30zgo\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003E\u003Ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"\u002F\u002Foembed.vice.com\u002F8X30zgo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMakes sense. But what about bugs that already live in northern climates?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThe species of bugs in northern areas can actually tolerate pretty broad temperature span. Because they experience really big swings in the north, it gets pretty hot in the north, then really cold in the winter, they can tolerate wide spans. But, if you go to a warm place like Florida, the average bug you pick up on the street can't even tolerate the same breadth of temperature change. If you look at the tropics, there's also much less room for species to migrate. So in an area like the eastern United States, there's a lot of room for species to move up the mountains that are in lowland areas or ways to move further north. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ESo possibly more bugs at higher altitudes, and higher latitudes. But what about heat-intolerant bugs who can't escape?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003ESo if you go to a place like Costa Rica, where they don't really have very much room to move, and it turns out they can't tolerate temperatures that are much higher than what they're already living in. So, that's one of the big things that we're having to deal with. Everyone originally predicted that northern species were going to be at risk, but [in] tropical areas, the species that live there don't really have anywhere to go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAren't there bugs already living at the tops of mountains that are fucked too?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EYes, exactly. If you're a species that really can't take very warm temperatures and you're at the top of a mountain already, and now you have all these other migrants in your territories, you're going to get knocked off. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELet's get specific. What are some bugs who will move around in the next few decades?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EIn the Smoky Mountains, for instance, there's a warm-tolerating species of ant that's moving it's way up the mountain over the last couple decades. So these things are already happening on a small scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat about the bugs around our houses?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EGood question. So down here in the South, everyone hates fire ants. They were about at their northern limit here in North Carolina—so they're limited by heat. In a warmer world, you would predict that fire ants are going to go a little bit more north, whether that's ten miles or a hundred miles north. [So] some people that were just out of the range to find fire ants might find that in the next decade or so that they have fire ants in their yard. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECan we say anything about the bugs living north of the Mason-Dixon Line?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EYou could expect things like the odorous house ant—which is the species that's on kitchen countertops especially in New York—to come out sooner. But I don't know if we can say too much about how warming is going to affect them. For one thing, if they're living in your house and you have A\u002FC, the environment they experience is going to be a little bit different than it is outside.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIn your area, what effects have you studied that don't involve ants?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThe bulk of all the other insects after you remove ants are these things called fungus gnats. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EI know the bastards very well. What about them?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThey were the most abundant insect outside of ants in our study, and they [experienced] the strongest negative impact from warming, particularly in spring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EShould I care? Gnats suck.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E[I] started to read through old literature about what fungus gnats do, what we know about their biology, and almost nothing is known about them. I think that's one of the craziest things we find with insects: [They] could be spore-dispersers, they could really be doing important things but we don't know. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cb\u003E Ah, so you're going to tell me that even the loss of an annoying insect has an unpredictable butterfly effect, right? \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FNlM0ZK4WZh8?t=105\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELike when Homer Simpson goes back in time\u003C\u002Fa\u003E?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThat's what we talk about a lot!

In 2013, Measham—along with drum 'n' bass DJ Wilf Gregory—founded a drug-harm-reduction NGO group called the Loop, which made international headlines last summer when it conducted the UK's first front-of-house drug testing (MAST) at UK music festivals like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vice.com\u002Fen_au\u002Farticle\u002Fdrug-testing-at-secret-garden-party\"\u003ESecret Garden Party\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and Kendal Calling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThis year, its reach is even wider: The ink hasn't quite dried on all the contracts, but the Loop will be providing drug testing at four or five commercial festivals. Add up all the guests at these events, and Fiona believes some 500,000 people will have access to a potentially lifesaving service. All this is a result of consultations with police and local authorities, as opposed to government officials, with permission being granted at a local rather than national level.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe Loop's presence at festivals last year was a breakthrough moment for all those who have spent years fighting to steer UK drug policy away from its traditional reliance on abstinence and criminal justice and toward a focus on public health and harm reduction. This shift is clearly much needed, as the stats show the government's current approach is bearing rotten fruit: A record 3,674 drug deaths were recorded in 2015, with 57 people dying after taking ecstasy—a result, in large part, of increased purity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\"Changing national policy is like turning an oil tanker around, but we were impatient, knowing every year people are dying,\" says Measham over the phone. \"National policy might take years and years to change, but drug deaths are going up.

She was an early starter, going to her first club when she was 13. By 15, she was working behind the bar and hitchhiking down to London's Marquee Club to watch the Specials. \"We'd hitch a ride at \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSpaghetti_Junction\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESpaghetti Junction\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, sneak into the club while they were sound-checking so we didn't have to pay, then hitchhike back,\" she remembers. \"By the time we got back to Birmingham, milk had been delivered, so we'd take a couple of bottles for breakfast before school.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe effect on her education couldn't have been too detrimental: Measham's day job is now professor of criminology at Durham University. As an academic, she's spent her career exploring the relationship between dance music and drugs, and co-authored the first British academic study on the topic: \u003Ci\u003EDancing on Drugs: Risk, Health, and Hedonism in the British Club Scene\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. She thinks coming from an academic background has helped in her seemingly infinite meetings with police, public health officials, and local authorities in her work with the Loop. \"As a professor of criminology, I'm not seen as automatically 'on the other side',\" she says, \"like I might if I was a drugs worker with dreadlocks and a Bob Marley T-shirt. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThose meetings are becoming ever more regular since last summer's successful drug testing pilots; hardly a surprise when you consider the stats from Secret Garden Party. Across two days, the Loop—run entirely by volunteers, the majority of them doctors and chemistry professors, with NHS nurses on hand to offer harm-reduction advice—tested more than 250 people's drugs. The results have been well reported: A quarter of people gave their drugs back, mostly put off by adulterants their drugs were cut with. For instance, crushed-up malaria tablets parading as ketamine and ecstasy pills composed of concrete. Critics fear that offering drug testing will normalize the idea of drug taking at clubs and festivals. Beyond missing the fact that it's already very normalized, with the evidence at hand, it's hard to argue that providing a service aimed at taking bad drugs out of people's hands is in any way a negative thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe NGO also conducts back-of-house testing at Manchester's Warehouse Project, where seized drugs are tested and any notably dangerous narcotics flagged up on the club's social media. It'll be doing the same at Manchester's Albert Hall and giving quarterly onsite harm-reduction advice at Fabric, where it has been training up management to deliver in-house harm-reduction welfare. (Speaking of Fabric, Measham was the expert witness in the successful appeal against its closure.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446539665-Fiona_Measham_PR_edits-8.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThings have come a long way since Measham moved to Manchester in 1991. The city was one focal point of the UK's rave scene, and a colleague of hers had set up the Rave Research Bureau. Measham was an assistant on the project, which sought to understand, from the dance floor up, the UK's biggest countercultural movement since punk. \"I went to the Hacienda and Sankeys, and of course, I loved it,\" she says. \"But I was never really taken by that house scene.

She's also showed that change can happen at a local level first, rather than having to come through changing laws at the top of government.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003E\u003Cpicture class=\"article__image\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 25em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg?resize=400:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg?resize=650:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg?resize=850:*, https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\"\u003E\u003Csource media=\"(min-width: 53.125em)\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg?resize=1000:*\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvideo-images.vice.com\u002F_uncategorized\u002F1495446589128-test.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\u003Cp class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003EA volunteer at the Loop testing drugs at last year's Secret Garden Party.

Measham's got a busy day tomorrow: She's centrally involved with a program in three Durham prisons called Inside Out, which helps inmates and undergraduates learn through shared time together under her supervision. She says it's \"incredibly rewarding\"—another part of her own life dedicated to improving other people's.
